              In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
              Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things
              were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was
              made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the
              light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

                  Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be
                  baptized by him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to
                  be baptized by thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus
                  answering said to him, Suffer [it to be so] now: for thus it
                  becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he suffered
                  him. And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out
                  of the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he
                  saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
                  upon him: And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my
                  beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

                  And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying, Blessed
                  [are] the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
                  Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
                  Blessed [are] the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
                  Blessed [are] they who hunger and thirst for righteousness:
                  for they shall be filled. Blessed [are] the merciful: for they
                  shall obtain mercy. Blessed [are] the pure in heart: for they
                  shall see God. Blessed [are] the peace-makers: for they shall
                  be called children of God. Blessed [are] they who are
                  persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom
                  of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and
                  persecute [you], and shall say all manner of evil against you

                  great [is] your reward in heaven: for so they persecuted the
